# stratego_single_player

This game was a designed as part of a final project for my Advanced Java Programming class with my classmate Christina Nguyen.
The game is to be played with 2 players that are sitting across from each other passing the computer over in between each turn.

Controls:
Arrows- to move around the board
Enter- to select/deselect a tile
D- used to confirm a turn
0-9- Keys used to choose from 10 different preset starting positions

Extra features:
-Some variants can be added, to make the game more interesting such as All Pawns Visible or Moving Bombs. These can be selected through the menubar and can  be mixed and matched. Restart the game to put your variant selection into effect.
-Link to the official Stratego rules can be accessed through the Menubar
